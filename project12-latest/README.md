# Project Title

Aerial Distance Calculator and Visualiser

## Purpose of the project

This is a Java based project that aims to calculate the aerial distance between two points located in Maastricht, as well as the time it would take to theoretically walk and bike said distance, using speed averages.

In addition to that, it also visualises these distances by placing two pins on a map of Maastricht, showing START and END locations with a green and red pin respectively.

The program accepts two postal codes as input, and has a clean and easy-to-use UI.
